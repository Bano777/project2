            Deforestation has always been a threat to our environment. But still many humans are continuing 
            this ill practice. Moreover, Deforestation is causing ecological imbalance. Yet, some selfish 
            people have to fill their pockets. Therefore they do not even think about it once. So, the 
            government is trying countermeasures to avert the harm to the environment. <br>
            <strong>Main purpose of Deforestation</strong> <br>
            The main purpose of deforestation is to increase the land area. Also, this land area is to set up 
            new industries. And, this all is because of the increase in population. As the population increases 
            the demand for products also increase. So rich businessmen set up these industries to increase 
            profit. <br>

            <strong class="text-2xl">Harmful Effects of Deforestation</strong><br>
            <strong class="underline">There are many harmful effects of deforestation. Some of them are below:</strong> <br>
            <strong>Soil erosion:</strong> <br>
            Soil erosion is the elimination of the upper layer of the soil. It takes place when 
            there is removing of trees that bind the soil. As a result wind and water carries away the top 
            layer of the soil. <br>

            Moreover, <strong>disasters</strong> like landslides take place because of this. Furthermore, soil erosion is 
            responsible for various floods. As trees are not present to stop the waters from heavy rainfallâ€™s 
            gush directly to the plains. This results in damaging of colonies where people are living. <br>

            <strong>Global Warming:</strong> Global warming is the main cause of the change in our environment. These seasons 
            are now getting delayed. Moreover, there is an imbalance in their ratios. The temperatures are 
            reaching its extreme points. This year it was 50 degrees in the plains, which is most of all. 
            Furthermore, the glaciers in the Himalayan ranges are melting. <br>

            <strong>Impact on the water cycle:</strong> <br>
           Since through transpiration, trees release soil water into the environment. Thus cutting of them is 
           decreasing the rate of water in the atmosphere. <br>

          <strong> A great threat to wildlife:</strong><br>
           Deforestation is affecting wildlife as well. Many animals like Dodo, Sabre-toothed Cat, Tasmanian 
           Tiger are already extinct. Furthermore, some animals are on the verge of extinction.

           <strong>How to Avert Deforestation?</strong> <br>
           Deforestation can be averted by various countermeasures. First of all, we should afforestation 
           which is growing of trees in the forest. This would help to resolve the loss of the trees cut down. 
           Moreover, the use of plant-based products should increase. <br>

           This would force different industries to grow more trees. As a result, the environment will also get 
           benefit from it. Furthermore, people should grow small plants in their houses. That will help the 
           environment to regain its ability. At last, the government should take strict actions against 
           people. Especially those who are illegally cutting down trees.
