               <strong class="text-2xl">Introduction</strong> <br> 
               Political instability refers to a state of uncertainty and unpredictability in the governance of a 
               country. Frequent changes in leadership, power struggles, and a lack of effective government 
               characterize it. Political instability can have a detrimental effect on a country’s economy, 
               leading to a decline in investment, trade, and economic growth. It can also result in inflation, 
               currency devaluation, poverty, and unemployment.  <br> <br>
       
                <strong class="text-4xl">Historical Examples of Political Instability Leading to the Economic 
                 Downfall</strong> <br>
                 Political instability is negatively impacting Pakistan’s economy right now. It is leading to a 
                 decline in economic growth, a drop in foreign investment, and a rise in inflation and unemployment.

                 <strong class="text-2xl">Venezuela</strong> <br>
                 Venezuela has been plagued by political instability and economic turmoil for several years. The 
                 country has been in a state of political crisis since the late 1990s.  The economic crisis has also 
                 resulted in a rise in poverty and unemployment. This has affected many people who are unable to 
                 access basic necessities such as food and medicine. <br>
                 <strong class="text-2xl">Myanmar</strong> <br>
                 The military coup and the subsequent violence, leading to the displacement of hundreds of thousands 
                 of people, has led to a decline in economic activity, and a drop in foreign investment. On February 1, 
                 2021, the Myanmar military, also known as the Tatmadaw, seized control of the government. <br>
                 <strong class="text-2xl">Greece</strong> <br>
                 Greece has experienced political instability and economic turmoil as a result of the financial 
                 crisis that began in 2008. The country’s economy was heavily dependent on borrowing. When the global 
                 financial crisis hit, the country found itself unable to repay its debt. <br><br>

                    In conclusion, political instability can have a severe and far-reaching impact on economic growth 
                    and development. Historical examples such as Venezuela, Myanmar, and Greece demonstrate how 
                    political instability can lead to economic turmoil, hyperinflation, currency devaluation, and a 
                    decline in economic growth. The political instability is impacting the business environment, trade 
                    and tourism, inflation, currency devaluation, lack of government accountability and transparency, 
                    and limited access to credit and financing.
