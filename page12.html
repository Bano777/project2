            Refugee crisis is a global societal problem for two major reasons; it is causing great suffering 
            to societies across the globe. Among the sufferings, include unmet goals in life, death of 
            civilians and separation of families. The second reason is that it is slowing down global 
            integration and progress. The failure to resettle refugees condemns them to poverty and cuts 
            them off from normal lives being led by other people. The situation created is one where not 
            every human on earth gets to enjoy equal human rights just because some are refugees. <br>

            <strong>First refugee crisis</strong><br>
            Fear and uncertainty drove many Americans to denounce the slave revolt that caused our nation's 
            first refugee crisis. But those who turned up on America's shores between 1791 and 1810 were 
            ultimately accepted as victims <br>

            <strong>Problems faced by refugees</strong><br>
            1.Violence <br>
            2.War. <br>
            3.Lack of food, water, and shelter. <br>
            4.Physical injuries, infections, and diseases. <br>
            5.Torture. <br>
            6.Forced labor. <br>
            7.Lack of medical care. <br>

            <strong>What are the effects of refugee crisis?</strong> <br>
            In urban areas, the influx of refugees may lead to water and electricity shortages, causing higher 
            costs for both the refugees and the host community, overcrowding of services such as health and 
            education, increased traffic and pollution, and competition for jobs and housing. <br>

            <strong>Four steps towards ending the refugee crisis</strong> <br>
            Work together. It's essential that wealthy countries work together to share the responsibility 
            for protecting refugees. <br>
            Increase support. <br>
            Protect asylum seekers. <br>
            Help tackle the root causes. <br>

            <strong>causes of refugees</strong><br>
            War and ethnic, tribal and religious violence are leading causes of refugees fleeing their 
            countries. 52% of all refugees and other people in need of international protection come from 
            just three countries: Syria, Ukraine, and Afghanistan. <br>

            <strong>solution to refugees</strong> <br>
            Voluntary repatriation may be one solution for refugees who have made the brave decision to return 
            home. Together with the country of origin and international community, UNHCR strives to facilitate 
            their choice through 'go-and-see' visits, education, legal aid, and family reunification.
