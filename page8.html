     <strong class="text-2xl">Cybersecurity</strong> means protecting data, networks, programs and other information from unauthorized or 
     unattended access, destruction or change. In today’s world, cybersecurity is very important because of 
     some security threats and cyber-attacks. For data protection, many companies develop software. This 
     software protects the data. Cybersecurity is important because not only it helps to secure information 
     but also our system from virus attack. After the U.S.A. and China, India has the highest number of 
     internet users. <br>

     <strong> Cyber Threats</strong> <br>
     It can be further classified into 2 types. Cybercrime – against individuals, corporates, etc.and 
     Cyberwarfare – against a state. <br>

     <strong>Cyber Crime</strong> <br>
     Use of cyberspace, i.e. computer, internet, cellphone, other technical devices, etc., to commit a crime 
     by an individual or organized group is called cyber-crime. Cyber attackers use numerous software and 
     codes in cyberspace to commit cybercrime. They exploit the weaknesses in the software and hardware 
     design through the use of malware. Hacking is a common way of piercing the defenses of protected 
     computer systems and interfering with their functioning. Identity theft is also common.

     <strong>Occurence</strong> <br>
     Cybercrimes may occur directly i.e,  targeting the computers directly by spreading computer viruses. <br>
     Malware is a software used to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access 
     to private computer systems. It usually appears in the form of code, scripts, active content, and other 
     software. ‘Malware’ refers to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software, for example, 
     Trojan Horses, rootkits, worms, adware, etc. <br>

     <strong>Cyber Warfare</strong> <br>
     Snowden revelations have shown that Cyberspace could become the theatre of warfare in the 21st century. 
     Future wars will not be like traditional wars which are fought on land, water or air. when any state 
     initiates the use of internet-based invisible force as an instrument of state policy to fight against 
     another nation, it is called cyberwar’.

     It includes hacking of vital information, important webpages, strategic controls, and intelligence. In 
     December 2014 the cyberattack a six-month-long cyberattack on the German parliament for which the Sofacy 
     Group is suspected. Another example 2008 cyberattack on US Military computers. Since these cyber-attacks, the issue of cyber warfare has assumed urgency in the global media.
<br><br>
     <strong>Inexpensive Cybersecurity Measures</strong> <br>
     The simplest thing you can do to up your security and rest easy at night knowing your data is safe is to change your passwords.
     You should use a password manager tool like LastPass, Dashlane, or Sticky Password to keep track of everything for you. These applications help you to use unique, secure passwords for every site you need while also keeping track of all of them for you.
     An easy way for an attacker to gain access to your network is to use old credentials that have fallen by the wayside. Hence delete unused accounts.
     Enabling two-factor authentication to add some extra security to your logins. An extra layer of security that makes it harder for an attacker to get into your accounts.
     Keep your Softwares up to date. <br><br>
     <strong>Conclusion</strong> <br>
     Today due to high internet penetration, cybersecurity is one of the biggest need of the world as 
     cybersecurity threats are very dangerous to the country’s security. Not only the government but also 
     the citizens should spread awareness among the people to always update your system and network security 
     settings and to the use proper anti-virus so that your system and network security settings stay virus 
     and malware-free
