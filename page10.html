            A study conducted to investigate global health’s plight reveals that it is at its utmost disaster. 
          The study shows that the new skills brought about by science and medicine have failed to meet the 
          global population’s needs. Although outstanding enhancements have been prepared in the health 
          condition globally over the last century, these improvements have not met the requirements of 
          everyone. The reason behind this is the dissimilar living standards in different countries. <br>

          The research shows that in the 21st century, hunger is the leading risk to health worldwide. A 
          report published by the World Health Organization reveals that hunger kills more people than cancer, 
          heart disease, AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined. It is also estimated that in every four 
          children, one is underweight. <br>

         Due to the underweight condition, a child is likely to die from infectious diseases because of 
         weakened immunity. According to one of the American researchers, “the hungry are the poorest of the 
         poor, and enhancements in poverty don’t automatically reach them” . <br>

        <strong class="text-2xl">Observations in Global Health Issues</strong><br>
        In general, global health issues have a significant impact on many countries,. It is 
        because the country has never enjoyed the fruits of its labor, unlike the other countries. Some of the 
        impacts, like poverty, malnutrition, and HIV/AIDS, have contributed significantly to a slowdown in the 
        country’s economic growth. Other impacts like poor sanitation facilities, poor quality healthcare 
        facilities, discrepancies between the poor and the rich, and low life expectancy have been part of the 
        health issues worldwide. <br>

        <strong class="text-2xl">Conclusion</strong> <br>
        Hunger is a global health issue that can leave someone with no joy at all. Hunger has proven to be the 
        leading disaster as a global health issue of significant concern to governments. The paper clearly 
        shows how hunger has resulted in the spread of HIV/AIDs, malnutrition, and poverty, among others, in 
        the world. <br>

        The paper also shows that the discrepancy between the poor and the rich contributes to poor health in 
        the world. Quality of healthcare and healthcare facilities has also contributed to most global health 
        issues like malnutrition, low maternity, and mortality rate. Sanitation that includes sewerage, 
        toilet, and drinking water are common issues inhibited in the world.
