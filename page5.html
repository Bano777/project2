            Few economic indicators are of more concern to Americans than unemployment statistics. Reports that 
            unemployment rates are dropping make us happy; reports to the contrary make us anxious.  <br><br>
            <strong class="underline">But just whatdo unemployment figures tell us? Are they reliable measures? What influences joblessness?</strong>
               <br><br>
           <strong> How Is Unemployment Defined and Measured?</strong> <br>
            Each month, the federal government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics randomly surveys sixty thousand 
            individuals around the nation. If respondents say they are both out of work and seeking employment,
             they are counted as unemployed members of the labor force. Jobless respondents who have chosen not
              to continue looking for work are considered out of the labor force and therefore are not counted 
              as unemployed. Almost half of all unemployment spells end because people leave the labor force.
              Ironically, those who drop out of the labor force—because they are discouraged, have household
              responsibilities, or are sick—actually make unemployment rates look better; the unemployment 
              rate includes only people within the labor force who are out of work. <br>
            
            Not all unemployment is the same. Unemployment can be long term or short term. It can be frictional,
             meaning someone is between jobs; or it may be structural, as when someone’s skills are no longer 
             demanded because of a change in technology or an industry downturn. <br><br>
            
            <strong>Is Unemployment a Big Problem?</strong> <br>
            Some say there are reasons to think that unemployment in the United States is not a big problem. In 
            June 2005, for example, 33.5 percent of all unemployed people were under the age of twenty-four, and
             presumably few of them were the main source of income for their families. One out of six of the 
             unemployed are teenagers. Moreover, the average duration of a spell of unemployment is short. In 
             June 2005 it was 16.3 weeks. And the median spell of unemployment is even shorter. In June 2005 
             it was 7.0 weeks, meaning that half of all spells last 7.0 weeks or less. <br>
            
            On the basis of numbers like the above, many economists have thought that unemployment is not a very
             large problem. A few weeks of unemployment seems to them like just enough time for people to move 
             from one job to another. Yet these numbers, though accurate, are misleading. Much of the reason why
            unemployment spells appear short is that many workers drop out of the labor force at least
            temporarily because they cannot find attractive jobs. Often two short spells of unemployment mean a 
            long spell of joblessness because the person was unemployed for a short time, withdrew from the labor 
            force, and then reentered the labor force. <br> <br>
            
           <strong> What Causes Long-Term Unemployment?</strong> <br>
            To fully understand unemployment, we must consider the causes of recorded long-term unemployment. 
            Empirical evidence shows that two causes are welfare payments and unemployment insurance. These 
            government assistance programs contribute to long-term unemployment in two ways. <br>
            
            First, government assistance increases the measure of unemployment by prompting people who are not
            working to claim that they are looking for work even when they are not. The work-registration 
            requirement for welfare recipients, for example, compels people who otherwise would not be considered 
            part of the labor force to register as if they were a part of it. This requirement effectively 
            increases the measure of unemployed in the labor force even though these people are better described 
            as nonemployed—that is, not actively looking for work. <br>
            
            The second way government assistance programs contribute to long-term unemployment is by providing an 
            incentive, and the means, not to work. Each unemployed person has a “reservation wage”—the minimum wage 
            he or she insists on getting before accepting a job. Unemployment insurance and other social assistance 
            programs increase that reservation wage, causing an unemployed person to remain unemployed longer.
            <br>
            Unemployment insurance also extends the time a person stays off the job. Clark and I estimated that the
             existence of unemployment insurance almost doubles the number of unemployment spells lasting more than 
             three months. If unemployment insurance were eliminated, the unemployment rate would drop by more than 
             half a percentage point, which means that the number of unemployed people would fall by about 750,000. 
             This is all the more significant in light of the fact that less than half of the unemployed receive 
             insurance benefits, largely because many have not worked enough to qualify.
