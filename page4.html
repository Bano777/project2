            The threat from terrorism will remain high and could worsen over the decade. There are now more 
        Islamist extremists from more countries active in more places than ever before. Extremists will
         continue to exploit fragile and violence-prone states, including in Southeast Asia, for safe havens
          and to build skills. Globally, terrorism will add to instability and drive international security
           interventions, especially in the Middle East and Africa. <br><br>

         Communications technology allows extremists to inspire or direct attacks remotely, often through
          encrypted means, underlining the complexity and unpredictability of the risks we face. New 
          technologies could make it easier for terrorists to make advanced biological or chemical warfare 
          agents. <br><br>

          Recent attacks and disruptions in Australia highlight the dynamic nature of the extremism challenge.
           With the conflicts in Syria and Iraq having energised Islamist extremists at a level not seen 
           before, these threats will have a generational impact. <br><br>

         Extremist narratives will continue to inspire violence globally, even as the so-called Islamic
          State (ISIL) loses ground in Iraq and Syria. Al Qaâ€™ida retains the intent to conduct attacks
           against western interests. Other groups are likely to emerge. The security and stability of
            Afghanistan will continue to be vital in containing the threat from international terrorism.
            <br><br>

        The terrorism threat in Southeast Asia is increasing because of links between local extremists and 
        terrorist groups such as ISIL, with the situation in the southern Philippines of pressing concern.
         We must plan on the basis that a mass casualty attack against western targets in Southeast Asia
          will take place. <br><br>

         <strong> How terrorism affect the world?</strong><br>
         Terrorist acts can cause ripple effects through the economy that have negative impacts.
          The most obvious is the direct economic destruction of property and lives. Terrorism indirectly
           affects the economy by creating market uncertainty, xenophobia, loss of tourism, and increased
            insurance claims.
